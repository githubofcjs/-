The original dataset was too big to update, so I just upload the data I need in the file 'my_data.txt'. 
The 'clean_data.R' is the code I write for selecting the data I need from the 124Mb txt file and cleaning NAs, and store them in 'my_data.txt ', assuming that the original dataset is in the workspace's file folder 'Exploraty_Data_analysis'.
The 'get_data.R' is a function to read 'my_data.txt'.
'plot1.R'~'plot4.R' and the png files created by these functions are the homework I submitted.
